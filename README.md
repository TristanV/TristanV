## 🖐 Hello, I'm Tristan Vanrullen, *always learning* AI engineer and data manager


My **AI Engineer** degree covers not only data analysis, machine learning and deep learning, but also AI related cloud architectures and ethical considerations plus AI project management. To read more about the 11 AI projects developed along this path, and other former projects, please have a look at my [🏡 **portfolio** and **resume** (in french)](https://tristanv.github.io)

🎯 In 2022 I started my fourth professional life when I graduated as 🎓*AI Engineer* (my field is also *ML Engineer*, *Data Analyst*, *Data Scientist* and *Data Manager*)! This is my natural evolution after my three former lives : 

- <details><summary>(2005-2012) As a PhD, researcher and lecturer in 💻<em>Computer Science</em> and 💬<em>Natural Language Processing</em>.</summary>With research in Computer Science and NLP, I found my deepest calling and the activity in which I recognize myself the most. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tristan-Vanrullen">Find out more on Researchgate</a>. 🤖Artificial intelligence is now fully a part of research and industry in NLP, enabling the design of solutions for everyday business and great future innovations. Beyond my former skills in symbolic linguistics, it was therefore necessary to learn how to design machine learning and deep learning solutions for NLP. It is a great asset now to master both approaches.</details> 

- <details><summary>(2006-2016) As a Fullstack developer, <em>freelance</em> then <em>lead programmer</em> in a few startups including my own.</summary> I have sold and delivered applications, web solutions and ERPs for various companies or organizations: in health, university, associations, small businesses. Thanks to these jobs, I have built a solid knowledge of organizational processes and business IT in the different departments of companies. These jobs allowed me to master the collaborative design and deployment of applications, from big databases to web or standalone front-ends, through complex server-side algorithms and electronic flows between systems. Data concerns, data structuration, data algorithms, were always present in my jobs. Personal data protection and ethical concerns in respect for patients and customers have always been in my mind constraints to deal with all along the software design process. Entering the era of <em>data management</em>, I am prepared to develop ethical and explainable solutions. </details>

- <details><summary>(2010, 2018-2020) As a business-oriented <em>project manager</em> or <em>information systems manager</em>.</summary>I managed software bricks, electronic flows, IT teams and software developers for a few companies. I was often confronted with communication issues between departments and direction. Communication in the decision chain and user training are important bases to guarantee the quality of data, from its collection to its exploitation. The need to include data governance in the processes of organizations is thus a very clear imperative. For this reason again, my evolution towards a transversal job of data manager was necessary.</details>

## 📅 Some recent updates

- 👀 I’m interested in **open source** collaborative development since my first professional software development in 1997. What a time to be a developer! When I wrote my first *basic* program in 1984, open source code was available in specialized newspapers. Now no-code and continuous delivery are realities. So what is still accurate after 37 years in programming computers? As far as I was involved in critical algorithms, 🤯the ability to **optimize memory and calculation complexities** remains a HUGE skill. 

- 🤝 Some collaborative projects are in progress on the following topics :
    - 🔭 **Courses and e-learning** exploration to gain bird-eye-view over training paths for data science in particular and any kind of diploma in general. See [OCCoursesExplorer](https://github.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer)
    - 🦄 **Skills** management and ontologies to help **matching resumes and job offers**.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently discovering very interesting ML models with 🤗 HuggingFace! 

- 🤟 Topics I enjoy as a hobby:
    - 🎸🎹 composing and playing music 
    - 🖌 drawing and painting
    - 💎 stone balancing
    - ☕ reading and writing technology watch content
